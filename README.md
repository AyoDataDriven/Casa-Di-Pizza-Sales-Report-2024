# Casa-Di-Pizza-Sales-Report-2024
# Introduction

In today’s competitive food service industry, data-driven decision-making is crucial for sustained profitability and customer retention. This report presents an analytical review of a pizza restaurant’s sales performance using historical transactional data. The goal is to uncover key patterns in customer preferences, sales trends, and product performance to support strategic business planning.

Although transactional data is often recorded in restaurants, it is rarely leveraged effectively to extract meaningful insights. Many establishments operate without clear visibility into which products generate the most revenue, seasonal demand patterns, or shifts in customer preferences. This lack of analytical insight creates gaps in marketing strategy, inventory planning, and product optimization.By transforming raw sales data into an interactive Power BI dashboard, this analysis provides a clear foundation for optimizing inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction, and improving overall revenue performance.

## Problem Statement
The pizza restaurant lacks a structured approach to analyzing sales data, making it difficult to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify best-selling products, and respond to seasonal sales fluctuations. This limits its ability to make informed, profit-oriented business decisions.

## Project Objective

This sales analytics report aims to:

Analyze monthly sales trends across the year.
Identify customer preferences by pizza size, category, and type
Determine top-performing and underperforming products.
Present interactive key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decisions
Dataset Overview
This dataset was downloaded from the Kaggle repository. This dataset contains transactional records of pizza orders from a restaurant. The dataset comprises 668 records (rows) with 12 columns of structured data, detailing sales, pizza types, order details, and pricing information.

# In-Analyis Report
## 1. Sales Trends

### Observation: Sales peaked in July ($72.6K) and remained strong in August ($71.4K), but dropped significantly in November ($64.1K) and December ($64.9K).

### Insight:High mid-year sales may correlate with summer vacations or outdoor events. Q4 decline suggests potential holiday-related challenges (e.g., competition, reduced dine-in traffic).

### Recomendation : Investigate promotional strategies during low months (e.g., holiday discounts, family meal deals).

## 2. Pizza Size Preference

Observation:Large pizzas dominated sales (45.89%, $375.32K).Medium (30.49%) and Small (21.77%) contributed significantly but trailed behind.

Insight:Customers prioritize value and sharing options.

Recommendation: Test bundling large pizzas with sides/drinks to further increase average order value.

3. Pizza Category Performance

Observation:Classic pizzas accounted for 74.2% of sales.Other categories (Supreme, Veggie, Chicken) each represented only 11–15%.

Insight:Strong brand loyalty to traditional flavors, but limited demand for premium/niche categories.

Recommendation: Introduce “Classic+” variations (e.g., “Classic Spicy”) to bridge the gap without alienating core customers.

4. Top-Selling Pizzas

Observation:The Thai Chicken Pizza generated the highest revenue ($63.43K).Other top performers: The Classic Chicken Pizza ($62.71K), The Barbecue Chicken Pizza ($35.18K).
Insight:Chicken-based and globally inspired flavors resonate with customers.
Recommendation: Highlight these as signature items and explore similar fusion recipes (e.g., “Thai Veggie” for non-meat options).
5. Underutilized Opportunities

Observation:XXL/XX sizes (if offered) show minimal contribution.
Veggie/Supreme categories underperform compared to Classic.

Insight:Potential misalignment between product offerings and customer needs.
Recommendation: Market XXL sizes for parties/events.
Run limited-time offers on Supreme/Veggie pizzas to test demand
